MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier

Description

This project is a deep learning model built using JAX and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and achieves a test accuracy of 99.14%.

Requirements

Python 3.x

JAX

Keras

TensorFlow

NumPy

Matplotlib

Install the required packages using:

pip install jax keras tensorflow numpy matplotlib

How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-classifier.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd mnist-classifier

Run the Python script:

python mnist_classifier.py

The model will train and evaluate its accuracy on the MNIST dataset.
